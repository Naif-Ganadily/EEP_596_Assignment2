# EEP 596 Assignment 2
# Spam Classification using Machine Learning
The primary objective of this assignment is to develop a model that can accurately classify emails as spam or not spam. By showcasing my understanding of natural language processing, machine learning, and data preprocessing techniques.

### Assignment Overview
The project is structured in several stages, including data preprocessing, feature extraction, model implementation, evaluation, and prediction on external test data. I have implemented and compared the following classification algorithms:

1- Logistic Regression

2- XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)

3- Random Forest

### Data Preprocessing and Feature Extraction
During the data preprocessing stage, I cleaned the dataset by removing duplicates, unnecessary characters, and applied tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization techniques. To convert the text data into a feature matrix, I utilized the Bag of Words model. This process allows for the transformation of textual data into numerical data that can be fed into machine learning algorithms.

Furthermore, I employed the chi-squared test to perform feature selection, identifying the most relevant features for classification. This step enhances the efficiency and accuracy of the models.

### Model Implementation and Evaluation
To train and evaluate the performance of different models, I split the dataset into training and validation sets. I assessed each model's performance using various metrics, such as precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy. Additionally, I analyzed the confusion matrix to gain insights into the true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative rates of the models.

### Prediction on External Test Data
Using the best-performing model, I predicted spam classification on an external test set. The results are saved in a CSV format, adhering to the desired submission format. This step demonstrates the model's ability to generalize well on unseen data, showcasing its practical applicability in real-world scenarios.

### Key Competencies
